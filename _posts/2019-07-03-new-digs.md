Finally moving into our own house.  It should be done around end of August.  I'm really excited because I finally get my own office instead of sharing it with my bedroom.  I can finally stream me coding online without having to worry about my wife or kids randomly strolling through to get something or get to the bathroom.

Once I'm settled, I plan on streaming on YouTube Live different scripts that could be helpful to CyberArk users and then posting them to my own account for viewing later.  This should help all the Vault Administrators out a lot who are just trying to make their lives better but aren't used to scripting... regardless the language.
