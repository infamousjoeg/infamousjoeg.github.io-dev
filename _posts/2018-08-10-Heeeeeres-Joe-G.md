Holy crap!  I've been gone for a while.

Been so busy just trying to keep up on everything DevOps that is happening out there.  It's like every day I hear about a new tool that uses secrets.  It's insane!

I'll be writing a lot more about DevOps, Secrets Management, and just my journey down Automation.  I've slacked for... man... almost a year now.

Time to get back to it!
